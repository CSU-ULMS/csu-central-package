                  <li>all books, ebooks, videos, archival collections, maps, music and other media in our collection</li>
                  <li>course materials that have been placed in the library (course reserves)</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Books and other media </h3>
                <p>If you can’t find your item at Fresno State, expand your search to all CSU libraries with <b>CSU+ Resource Sharing</b>. If your item is available at another CSU library, you can request it and have it sent to Fresno State.  Otherwise, you can use interlibrary loan to request items not available at Fresno State or other CSU libraries.</p>
                <h3>Articles</h3>
                <p>Not all articles that the library has access to can be found with OneSearch. If you can’t find a specific article in OneSearch, use our Citation Linker or Journal Title List to check whether the the library has access to the article. If not, you can request the article through <a href="https://ill.lib.csufresno.edu/">interlibrary loan</a>.</p>
